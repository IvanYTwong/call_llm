## Test 1: AI Startup Strategy

**Question:** You want to start an AI startup in 2025 with limited funding. What problem should you focus on, and what's your go-to-market strategy? Be specific about your target customer and competitive advantage.

---

### Model: `llama-4-maverick`

**Response:**

Starting an AI startup in 2025 with limited funding requires focusing on a specific, high-value problem. I recommend targeting small businesses that need AI-powered customer service automation. The go-to-market strategy involves creating a simple chatbot that can handle common customer inquiries, reducing the need for human support staff. Target customers are small e-commerce businesses and local service providers who can't afford expensive enterprise solutions. The competitive advantage is offering a no-code solution that businesses can set up in minutes, with pricing starting at $29/month. This approach has low technical barriers, clear customer pain points, and a scalable business model.

For a 2025 AI startup with limited funding, focus on AI-powered content generation for small businesses. The problem: Small businesses struggle to create consistent, high-quality content for marketing. Go-to-market strategy: Offer a SaaS platform that generates blog posts, social media content, and email campaigns using AI. Target customers: Marketing agencies and small businesses (10-50 employees) with limited content creation resources. Competitive advantage: Industry-specific templates, multi-language support, and integration with popular tools like WordPress and Mailchimp.

### Model: `deepseek-r1`

Target customers: Retail stores, restaurants, and service businesses with 5-100 employees. Go-to-market: Start with a free tier offering basic analytics, then upsell advanced features.

### Model: `gpt-oss-20b`

**Response:**

For a 2025 AI startup, I recommend focusing on AI-powered inventory management for small retailers. The problem: Small businesses lose money due to overstocking, understocking, and inefficient inventory tracking. Solution: AI system that predicts demand, optimizes stock levels, and automates reordering. Target customers: Independent retailers, small chains, and online sellers. Go-to-market: Partner with existing POS system providers for integration. Competitive advantage: Machine learning that improves with each business's data, reducing waste by 20-30%.
